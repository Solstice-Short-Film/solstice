### **Asset**

An Asset is a character, prop, set, script, ... really any piece that we need to use to create Solstice Short Film

!!! info
    Artella stores assets in **containers (folders)**. A **container** stores everything that pertains to that specific 
    asset (textures, shaders, meshes, etc)
    
> Summer Asset "Container"
![Summer Asset](../../img/summer_asset.png?style=centerme)

By default, when an asset is created, Artella creates some default folders and files to start working on, such as 
art, model, textures, ...

> Summer Asset Files and Folders
![Summer Asset Files and Folders](../../img/artella_summer_files.png?style=centerme)

In Artella projects and assets must be published before bring them into shots.

!!! info
     Assets only can be published by the director or by team leads.

### **Sequence**

Artella organizes a short film, as in real film production, in sequences. Those sequences are containers that stores 
all the shots of the short film. 

> Sequences "Containers" of Solstice
![Artella Sequences](../../img/artella_sequence.png?style=centerme)

When you create a new sequence, Artella creates two folders automatically:

***

### **_editorial**

This folder is where all files generated by each department are stored. For instance, when you've moved into animation 
the .mov files that are generated should be put in the _editorial/anim folder.

***

### **_master_layout**
This folder is the **bridge** between Assets and Sequences.

### **Shots**
**Work in Progress**
